This script will automatically identify missing mods, download them and launch DayZ with the mods. Just follow the instructions in the terminal window.
\
\
This script can launch modded servers and vanilla servers.
\
\
\
\
**How To:**
\
\
\
1: Add script to your 'home' folder.
\
\
2: Run 'bash DayZ_Mod_Launcher.sh' in the terminal.
\
\

\
\

\
\
3_2: Static Mod Setup (Set IP:Port, Query Port and Username in the script file. See line 68 ish in the script)
\
